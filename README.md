# Ai3M---FoX-50mm-ZX-Axis

Anycubic i3 Mega redesigned ZX axis with 50mm X gantry system

The Anycubic I3 Mega, known and as Ai3M, is an excellent entry level 3d printer. It has a rigid mainframe, a very good heat bed, decent electronics and a low acquisition price. I have to mention and the great community support for the Marlin firmware evolution. The main weak points are the unreliable hot-end assembly, the positioning of the heavy Bowden extruder attached to and way out from the center plane of the X-gantry, the sheet metal construction of the Z-carriages, week, wobbly and unable to correctly self constrain the geometry of the complete ZX axis, the lack of tensioning features for X and Y belts.  

Any 3d printing passionate and ambitious Ai3M user, once has passed the 3d printing childhood period, might feel the need to completely revise this printer or to move to another 'higher level" 3d printer. The options are: paying at least three times the cost of an Ai3M and getting a printer that might still needs upgrades, tinkering and care - or paying much less and turning the Ai3M into a machine that can finally offer perfect printing quality in a package with fun, enjoyment, a bit of challenges and a lot of satisfaction.

Some of the models included in the main step file are  gathered from various sources - Grabcad, Thingiverse, Github etc. A great, renewed "Thank you" for everyone who spent time to digitize these models.

Why "FoX"? - because the FoX has outsmarted the Bear :)
